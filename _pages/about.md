Hi! I am a 3rd-year undergraduate at <strong>Zhiyuan College (Honor, Top 10%), Shanghai Jiao Tong University</strong>.
My academic journey has been enriched by several research experiences.
Most recently, I was a research intern at <strong>National University of Singapore</strong>, collaborating with <a href="https://www.zhaominwu.com/">Dr. Zhaomin Wu</a> and <a href="https://profile.junyi.dev/">Mr. Junyi Hou</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/">Prof. Bingsheng He</a>.
Before that, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, working alongside <a href="https://zhxie.site/">Mr. Zhihui Xie</a>, mentored by <a href="https://shuaili8.github.io/">Prof. Shuai Li</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-ARmXsAAAAJ">Dr. Tong Yu</a>.
I've also had the privilege of collaborating with <a href="https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/">Prof. Bao-Liang Lu</a> and <a href="https://weilongzheng.github.io/">Prof. Wei-Long Zheng</a>.

Besides research, I've excelled in competitive programming, winning awards in OI, ICPC, CCPC and various other contests, under the guidance of <a href="https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu">Prof. Yong Yu</a>. See my <a href="assets/pdf/CV_Jizhou_Guo.pdf">CV</a> for details.

My research interests are primarily focused on Large Language Models and Foundation Models. I'm always eager to engage in discussions about these topics, so please feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!

**Model-Based Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Transfer for Large Language Models**

Zhaomin Wu*, **Jizhou Guo**\*, Junyi Hou, Bingsheng He, Lixin Fan, Qiang Yang

_Under review_ 

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10481">[arXiv]</a>

- Proposed **Llamdex**, a novel framework that integrates privacy-preserving, domain-specific models into LLMs.
- Demonstrated significant performance gains in domain-specific tasks, **with up to 26% accuracy improvement** while maintaining differential privacy guarantees.
- Achieved comparable inference efficiency to base LLMs while enhancing domain-specific capabilities.

- Developed a novel "**internal consistency**" approach to calibrate reasoning in LLMs, **resulting in a significant boost in reasoning performance** without requiring additional training.
- Conducted in-depth analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs through the lens of internal representations.

<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am a 4th-year undergraduate at Zhiyuan College (Honor, Top 10%), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Most recently, I was mentored by <a href="https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/philip-yu/">Prof. Philip S. Yu</a> at the University of Illinois Chicago.
Before that, I was a research intern at the National University of Singapore under the supervision of <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/">Prof. Bingsheng He</a>.
Prior to that, I was mentored by <a href="https://shuaili8.github.io/">Prof. Shuai Li</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-ARmXsAAAAJ">Dr. Tong Yu</a> at SJTU.
I've also had the privilege of collaborating with <a href="https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/">Prof. Bao-Liang Lu</a> and <a href="https://weilongzheng.github.io/">Prof. Wei-Long Zheng</a>.

My work has been published at venues such as EMNLP (main), ICML (AI4MATH), and NeurIPS, and I was invited as a reviewer for conferences including ICLR 2026. Beyond research, I've excelled in competitive programming, winning awards in OI, ICPC, CCPC, and other contests under the guidance of <a href="https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu">Prof. Yong Yu</a>.

My research interests are primarily focused on Large Language Models (Foundation Models) and Natural Language Processing. I'm always eager to engage in discussions about these topics, so please feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!
